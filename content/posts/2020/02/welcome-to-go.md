## Golang as common language

In January 2020 I took the chance to present my talk "**Welcome to Go**" about the [Go Programming Language] at [Guild42.ch]. Over 85 developers from around Berne where interested in the topic. Until there I was telling only Swiss Post stuff about Golang and argued about why the language is very useful. I felt ready to speak to more people about my and Swiss Posts journey with Go.

> The open source programming language has found many followers worldwide in recent years and mainstream technologies like Kubernetes has been written in Go. Due to the **simplicity** and wide range of use of the language, they use many DevOps teams, especially for aids in the system engineering area.
>
> Swiss Post is also following this path. In this lecture, Philip Sahli explains why and how he started Go, explains the elements of the language and the integrated tooling. The advantages of Go and the use in a DevOps team are emphasized.
