> Elm is a functional language that compiles to JavaScript. It helps you make websites and web apps. It has a strong emphasis on simplicity and quality tooling.

Elm is a domain-specific programming language for creating web browser-based graphical user interfaces. 

It's main features are:

- Immutability
- Static types
- Module system
- Interoperability with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

It's main advantages are:

- No runtime exceptions
- Great performance
- Small assets

The main advantage for a developer is that when the Elm compiler is happy with the code, browsers and users will be happy too (the same feeling Go developers have).

On [ELM Package](https://package.elm-lang.org/) the community shares reusable packages. 

[Justin Herrick](https://twitter.com/jah2488) maintains a curated list at [github.com/jah2488/elm-companies](https://github.com/jah2488/elm-companies) of companies using ELM in production.

A disadvantage might be that it is a new language for a developer to learn, and pure functional. But you can find a lot of good resources, that I share with you at the bottom of this page.
